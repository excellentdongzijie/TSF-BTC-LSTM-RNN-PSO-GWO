Time Series Forecasting of Bitcoin Prices using LSTM and RNN with Particle Swarm Optimization and Grey Wolf Optimizer
# Abstract: 
The volatility and unpredictability of Bitcoin prices have attracted significant attention from investors and researchers. In this research, we aim to develop accurate time series forecasting models for Bitcoin prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) while incorporating two optimization algorithms: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). The motivation behind this study arises from the need to enhance the precision of Bitcoin price predictions to aid investors in making informed decisions and mitigating potential risks. Additionally, exploring the impact of optimization algorithms on LSTM and RNN models can provide insights into improving forecasting accuracy. The methodology involves pre-processing the historical Bitcoin price data, partitioning it into training and testing sets, and implementing LSTM and RNN models with integrated PSO and GWO optimization algorithms. The models are then trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set to measure their forecasting performance. The findings indicate that the LSTM model with GWO optimization outperforms all other combinations, achieving the lowest values for Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE). This result suggests that the Grey Wolf Optimizer effectively enhances LSTM's forecasting capabilities for Bitcoin prices. In conclusion, this research demonstrates the potential of LSTM and RNN models in predicting Bitcoin prices and highlights the significance of optimization algorithms in further improving accuracy. The findings offer valuable insights to investors and researchers in the cryptocurrency domain, paving the way for more refined forecasting techniques in the future. However, it is crucial to consider other factors, such as external market influences and the dynamic nature of cryptocurrencies, for comprehensive decision-making
